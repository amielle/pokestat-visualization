# Pokémon statistics
Pokémon statistics scraped from [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net). Placed in pickle file for easier analysis in Python. Can be used for visualizing Pokémon information, generating new Pokémon using the names and creating a model to pick viable statistics depending on the type, and others.
